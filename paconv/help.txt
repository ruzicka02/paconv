PAConv - Pixel Art Converter
Created by Simon Ruzicka, 2023

First of all, make sure that the `img` directory contains:
  - source image [filename].png
  - list of colors [filename].txt

The list of colors in RGB must have the following format:

#00ff00
#ff00ff
...

Then, launch the script using:
    python paconv [file_name]
    python paconv [file_name] [width] [height]

if target width/height is not selected, the file will be 16 x 16 by default.
Resulting image will be generated in the root directory as `result.png`.
