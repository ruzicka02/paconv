First of all, make sure that the source image named [file_name].png is located
in your current working directory. In case the file is in another directory, include
the relative path instead of [file_name] when launching the script.

In addition, you can include a list of colors named [file_name].txt. In that case,
the script parameter must be only the common name of the files - without any
filename extension. Both files must be in one directory so that the script
locates them both correctly.

The optional list of colors must have the following format (in RGB):

#00ff00
#ff00ff
...

Then, you can launch the script using one of the following commands:

python -m paconv [file_name]
1) The resulting image will be 16 px in height - width will be automatically calculated.

python -m paconv [file_name] [height]
2) The resulting image will have given height - width will be automatically calculated.

python -m paconv [file_name] [height] [width]
3) The resulting image will have given height and width.

Resulting image will be generated in the current working directory, named as result.png.
There will also be an upscaled version with height approximately equal to 512 pixels
(so that the upscale factor is a whole number) named result_scaled.png.
This generates only in case where this upscale would have an effect (when the factor
is greater than 1 when rounded to integer).
